### Security Best Practices

When using WP Env:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive values to version control
2. **Production Settings**: Use appropriate environment detection in production
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to configuration files
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep WP Env and dependencies updated
5. **Audit Logs**: Monitor environment variable access in production

### Security Features

WP Env includes several security features:

- **Sensitive Key Protection**: Automatic detection and protection of sensitive keys
- **No Cache for Secrets**: Sensitive values are never cached
- **WordPress Integration**: Follows WordPress security best practices
- **Type Safety**: Strict typing reduces injection risks

### Known Security Considerations

- This library reads environment variables and WordPress constants
- Sensitive data should be properly protected at the system level
