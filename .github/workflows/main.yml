  # Optional: Only for post-merge verification (after PR is already approved).
  # Note: PR merge is technically a "push", so this trigger will fire after successful merges.
  # In a proper PR/GitHub workflow, protected branches should only receive PR merges.
  # This trigger only makes sense for:
  # - Hotfixes that bypass PR workflow in emergencies
  # - Unprotected branches that still accept direct pushes (not recommended)
  # - Post-merge verification (redundant if PR tests passed)
  # Remove this entirely if all branches are properly protected with required PR reviews.

      # Security Compliance Note for Snyk Action:
      # Snyk requires using full commit SHA instead of version tags or @master/@main 
      # for security compliance and to prevent supply chain attacks.
      # 
      # To update SHA hash:
      # - Visit: https://github.com/snyk/actions/commits/master/
      # - Copy the full 40-character commit SHA from the latest commit
      #
      # SARIF Upload Benefits:
      # - Integrates vulnerability results directly into GitHub's Security tab
      # - Provides detailed vulnerability information in pull request reviews
      # - Enables security-focused code review workflow
      # - Creates security alerts for repository maintainers
